# Scam_Phrase_Detection_Device

The Scam Phrase Detection Puck Device is a compact, always-listening hardware solution designed to protect users from fraudulent calls. The puck will detect high-risk scam phrases in real time using on-device keyword spotting / lightweight AI models and instantly alert the user through vibration/buzzer, and LED indicators.
This project will be executed in three milestones: auditing the previous design + firmware demo, designing a compact PCB, and developing a fully functional, tested prototype ready for shipment to the UK. The device will be optimized for low power consumption, real-time phrase detection, and future ease of integration via BLE.
